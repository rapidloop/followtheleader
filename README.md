`followtheleader` is a [Go](http://golang.org/) demo that fetches follower stats
from Twitter about the 2016 US Presidential Candidates and visualizes it via a web UI.

Check the [blog post](https://www.opsdash.com/blog/twitter-followers-in-go.html)
for a description of `followtheleader` internals.
